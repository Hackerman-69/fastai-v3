# A web application for an eye disease prediction model

The entire template for the application was forked and modified from [render-examples]( https://github.com/render-examples ) for [fastai-v3](https://github.com/render-examples/fastai-v3)

The model was trained with the fastai library and the resnet34 architecture. The dataset was obtained from google images and cleaned.
